###Abstract


Musicians today are surrounded with all kinds of technology for the benefits of music composition. Musicians are not always in the company of other musicians when they want to practice on their own. Music is not always one track sound. Usually, no one can play more than one instrument per person and this is a problem. There is a mechanism that has been created for this need, called a loop, and that is to record a segment of audio and play it back infinitely. This is used for a variety of applications like pattern creation, practice, etc. The problem arises when creating loops, especially when they are recorded on top of itself, when it is desired to remove a previously recorded segment, or edit it. Our goal is to be able to use a simple stompbox that can be a function loop sampler, and be able to edit each track individually.
